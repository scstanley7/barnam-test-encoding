               <lb/>Feel it a duty to express their gratitude at
               <lb/>The Remarkable Success
               <lb/>Which has attended, for the past twelve-month, their endeavors to provide for an appreciative
               <lb/>public, a
               <lb/>PLACE OF INTELLECTUAL ENTERTAINMENT
               <lb/>Worthy of the general approbation, and one that should commend itself to the popular regard, as well
               <lb/>for its
               <lb/>SPIRIT OF PUBLIC ENTERPRISE
               <lb/>AS FOR THE
               <lb/>NOVELTY AND AMUSEMENT
               <lb/>Characteristic of its peculiar performances. It is a satisfaction to be able conscientiously to add, that
               <lb/>the Museum, during the year 1856, was attended by
               <lb/>Over half a Million of Visitors
               <lb/>A patronage, which, it is thought, has not been surpassed, if equalled by that of any place of similar resort for pastime in the
               <lb/>world. As every Dollar of
               <lb/>THE PROFIT HAS BEEN EXPENDED

               <lb/>worthy of purchase and preservation, the Management conceives that the
               <lb/>UNPARALLELED PROSPERITY
               <lb/>of
               <lb/>THE MUSEUM
               <lb/>May be regarded, not only as a compliment to their own judgement, and to the taste of their visitors, but as a guaruntee of their
               <lb/>unswerving determination to merit the flattering favors they enjoy.
